# password-strength
#tips from the evaluvation
Short, simple passwords (e.g., simple123) are very weak ‚Äî they can be cracked quickly.

Adding uppercase letters improves strength slightly but is not enough on its own.

Numbers alone don‚Äôt make a password strong if the word or pattern is predictable.

Mixing uppercase, lowercase, and numbers (e.g., GreenTiger7) gives medium strength.

Adding symbols (e.g., !MoonRise88) greatly increases strength because it expands the character set.

Avoid dictionary words or common patterns ‚Äî even with numbers (e.g., C0ffeeBean) they‚Äôre easier to guess.

Longer length (12+ characters) is more important than complexity alone.

Randomized combinations (e.g., V!3x#2mQw*7R) are the strongest since they lack patterns.

Replacing letters with symbols (e.g., @ for a) helps, but common substitutions are still predictable.

Best practice is to use random, unique passwords for each account, ideally generated by a password manager.

#Best practices


## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

1. **Length Matters**

   * Aim for **at least 12‚Äì16 characters** (longer is stronger).
   * Short passwords, even with special characters, can still be cracked quickly.

2. **Use a Mix of Character Types**

   * Include **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **special symbols** (`!@#$%^&*` etc.).
   * Avoid predictable substitutions (e.g., `P@ssw0rd!` is still weak).

3. **Avoid Personal Information**

   * Don‚Äôt use names, birthdays, addresses, or words easily associated with you.
   * Hackers often try personal details first.

4. **Randomness is Key**

   * Use **unpredictable combinations** of characters.
   * Passwords like `Tr3e!MoOn$9zP` are harder to guess than real words.

5. **Passphrases Instead of Passwords**

   * Use a string of unrelated words with symbols/numbers (e.g., `Purple!Banana7Horse@Cloud`).
   * Easier to remember but still strong.

6. **Unique for Every Account**

   * Never reuse the same password across services.
   * A breach in one site could compromise all your accounts.

7. **Use a Password Manager**

   * Tools like **Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass, or KeePass** can generate and store long, unique passwords.
   * This prevents reuse and helps you manage complex ones.

8. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)**

   * Even a strong password can be stolen.
   * Add **an extra layer** (like an authenticator app or hardware key).

9. **Rotate Only When Necessary**

   * Change passwords if there‚Äôs a suspected breach.
   * Forced regular changes can lead to weaker, reused patterns.

10. **Check for Breaches**

* Use sites like **haveibeenpwned.com** to see if your credentials are exposed.
* Immediately update compromised ones.



## üîê Common Password Attacks

1. **Brute Force Attack**

   * Attackers try **every possible combination** of characters until the correct password is found.
   * Time required depends on **password length and complexity**.
   * Short/simple passwords can be cracked in seconds; long/random ones may take years or centuries.

2. **Dictionary Attack**

   * Attackers use a **list of common words, phrases, and known passwords** to guess quickly.
   * Weak passwords like `password123` or `qwerty` are easily caught.
   * Even substitutions like `P@ssw0rd!` may still appear in these lists.

3. **Hybrid Attack**

   * Mix of brute force and dictionary.
   * Starts with a dictionary word and adds variations (e.g., `summer2025!`).

4. **Credential Stuffing**

   * Attackers use **previously stolen username/password pairs** from breaches to log in on other sites.
   * This works if users **reuse passwords** across accounts.

5. **Phishing & Social Engineering**

   * Instead of guessing, attackers **trick users** into revealing passwords via fake emails, websites, or messages.



## üõ°Ô∏è How Password Complexity Affects Security

1. **Length is the biggest factor**: Longer passwords exponentially increase brute-force time.

   * Example: An 8-character password can be cracked in hours; a 16-character random password may take centuries.

2. **Character variety matters**: Using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols expands the character set, making brute-force attempts slower.

3. **Randomness reduces predictability**: A password like `!Tr7p$Qm9X2` is much harder to crack than `Summer2025!`.

4. **Dictionary resistance**: Complex and random strings resist dictionary attacks since they aren‚Äôt based on common words.

5. **Uniqueness prevents reuse attacks**: Even if one site is breached, attackers can‚Äôt use the same password elsewhere.
